üì¶ Delete Activity ‚Äì Azure Data Factory

üéØ Objective

This pipeline demonstrates how to use the Delete Activity in Azure Data Factory to remove specific processed sales files from a staging folder in Azure Blob Storage.

It directly deletes the listed files without using wildcards, conditions, or metadata checks.

| \*\*Recursive\*\*           | `False` (not required since file paths are direct)                                                                                 |

üîÑ Pipeline Flow

Delete Activity



Dataset points to each of the exact files in the staging folder.



No condition or existence check ‚Äî pipeline assumes files are present.



If any file is missing, pipeline will fail for that activity.



üìÅ Files Included



| File                                           | Purpose                                                       |

| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `pipelines/DeleteSpecificSalesFiles.json`      | ADF pipeline containing Delete Activity for each file         |

| `datasets/SalesFile1.json` ‚Äì `SalesFile6.json` | Datasets pointing to each specific sales file in Blob Storage |

| `linkedServices/BlobStorage.json`              | Linked Service to Azure Blob Storage                          |

| `sample-data/`                                 | Example sales files for testing                               |



‚úÖ Output

When all files exist:



All 6 files are deleted from the staging folder successfully.



When any file is missing:



Delete Activity for that file fails, causing the pipeline to fail unless error handling is configured.



üìå Best Practices



Use error handling (Retry / Continue on Error) if files may not always be present.



Avoid running in production without backup if data retention is required.



Group deletes in a ForEach loop if you want to maintain a single dataset with parameterized file names.
